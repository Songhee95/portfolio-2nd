          <p>
            With a foundation as an iOS application developer and full stack web
            developer, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and
            analytical abilities to the table. Transitioning into a data analyst
            role while pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in computer science with a
            focus on analytics has equipped me with the skills to transform
            complex data into actionable insights. I am passionate about
            leveraging my diverse background to drive innovative solutions that
            enhance user experiences and optimize business outcomes. My journey
            reflects a commitment to continuous learning and a desire to make a
            meaningful impact in the data-driven landscape.
